# Usage
Slack and Smmry tokens are taken from the nonexistent file `auth.js` with the following structure:

```json
var keys = {
    'slack': 'slack-key',
    'smmry': 'smmry-key'
}
```

Create the `auth.js` file and populate it with your keys. Then run the bot with `node index.js`.

## Commands
To show all available commands use `help` in slack
